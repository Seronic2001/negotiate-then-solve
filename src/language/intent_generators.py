"""More request generators, registered with what they hold out, for data that later runs extend.

``language.intent_corpus`` made the first generators: five wordings each, the last one held out for the
test split. This module adds generators for what the evaluations and probes found the model does not yet
read (how firmly something is asked, which class a move is for against where it should go, weeks counted
from now, several requests in one message, the ways clubs ask for rooms, requests too vague to act on),
and registers each one:

* ``Generator``: a name, the function, how many wordings it has, which wordings are **held out** and the
  evaluation suite they go to (``data/suites/<suite>.jsonl``). Held-out wordings never reach training, so a
  suite measures wordings the model has not seen; phrase banks are split the same way (``_split``).
* ``since``: the schema version (``intents.SCHEMA_VERSION``) the generator needs. A later run adds
  generators to ``REGISTRY``; the ones already there keep their seeds and wordings, so their rows stay the
  same rows and an adapter updated with ``INIT_FROM`` reads only what is new.

Labels follow one rule for how firm a request is (``lexicon.placement_is_hard`` and the phrase banks
here): a requirement only when the message says it must be so (or, for a move, names a conflict with
where the class is now); a hedged or plain request is a wish; "hard for me" is about difficulty, not a
requirement.
