"""The examination regulations, applied as a rule rather than left to a model (``data/policies/exam-regulations.pdf``).

    ruling = exam_ruling([7], {"EXAM-3.1": text, "EXAM-3.2": text})   # -> forward to the examination cell
    ruling = exam_ruling([8], rules)                                   # -> refuse: an examination week

Two rules of that document decide every change that touches the weeks around the examinations:

    EXAM-3.1  no regular classes are held in the examination weeks (8 and 16): a change in them is refused
    EXAM-3.2  no change may take effect in weeks 7, 8, 15 or 16 without the Controller of Examinations' written
              approval: a change in weeks 7 or 15 is forwarded to the examination cell

The week numbers are read from the rules' own text, so another calendar's regulations work unchanged, and nothing
applies to a department whose corpus has no EXAM-3.2 (the synthetic handbook alone). Both the request pipeline
(``pipeline.orchestrator``) and the agent (``nts.tools.end.submit``) call it, so the two systems cannot differ on
what the regulations say: the models only have to read which weeks a request is for.
