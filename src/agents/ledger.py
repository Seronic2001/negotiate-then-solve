"""Concession ledger and fairness measures (proposal Sections 9.6-9.7 and 13).

Every accepted concession adds weighted credit to the stakeholder who
conceded: ``importance(k) x magnitude(k)``, so giving up a verified
unavailability weighs more than giving up a preference, and a partial
concession (a counter-offer) weighs less than dropping the constraint.
Credit lowers the chance of being asked to concede again, and it decays each
semester so history matters without dominating.

The same weighted credits are each stakeholder's *concession burden*; how
unevenly burden falls is summarised by the Gini coefficient, the maximum
individual burden and the coefficient of variation (``dispersion``).
