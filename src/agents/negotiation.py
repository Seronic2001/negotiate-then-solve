"""Negotiation: the resolution ladder (proposal Section 8.6).

1. Auto-substitute: if the hard constraints are jointly feasible, repair the
   timetable (moving other classes) and notify. No one is asked.
2. Auto-relax: soft preferences the repair could not keep are dropped by the
   objective; their owners get a notice and may appeal.
3. Negotiate: on infeasibility, find the MUS and the minimal correction sets
   (MCS) within the relaxable tiers, rank them by cost, and ask the owner of
   the cheapest option, offering two or three solver-verified alternatives
   with a grounded explanation. Replies are accept / reject / counter; the
   constraints are updated and CP-SAT re-solves.
4. Escalate: on deadlock, no reply, the round limit, or a conflict only
   Tier 1-2 authorities could relax, send a brief up the reporting chain.

Each reply becomes exactly one typed tool call (proposal brief Section 4.3):
``accept(option_id)``, ``apply_reply(constraint)``, ``counter_propose(option)``,
``ask_clarification(question)``, ``decline(reason)`` or ``escalate(reason)``.
The ladder, not the LLM, decides what each call does; a counter-proposal is
offered onward only if CP-SAT verifies it.

Baseline and ablation switches: ``option_source="llm"`` lets the LLM invent
options and shows them unchecked (B3); ``"llm-filtered"`` drops the ones
CP-SAT rejects and regenerates up to three times (B4);
``PriorityModel(flat=True)`` without a ledger is A1; the explainer's mode is
A2; ``RuleReplyParser`` instead of ``ReplyParser`` is A3.
