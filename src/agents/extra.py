"""Extra classes: "On Thursday in week 11 I want an extra class."

The timetable is a fixed set of weekly sessions and every other request limits where they go; an
extra class adds one, for one week. It is handled outside the parser and the solver, like a swap:

1. ``ExtraReader`` finds which class it is (a copy of one of the sender's weekly sessions: same
   course, section, length and kind of room), the week, and any day or time asked for. When the
   sender teaches several classes and the message does not say which, or no week is given, it
   returns a question. A clarification answer is appended to the text, so the last week named wins.
2. ``free_placements`` lists the times in that week when the teacher, the section and a suitable
   room are all free, every hard rule in force that week is kept (the lunch break, closures,
   absences, consecutive-hour limits), and nothing else has to move.
3. ``block_constraints`` turns the chosen placement into hard Tier 2 constraints for that week (the
   teacher, each section and the room are taken at that hour), so later solves of the week keep
   clear of it without the solver having to know the extra session.

Deterministic throughout: the fine-tuned model was never trained on extra classes.
