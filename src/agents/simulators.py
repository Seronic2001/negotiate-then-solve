"""Stakeholder simulators with hidden flexibility (proposal Sections 8.6, 12).

A simulated faculty member states a constraint as absolute, but privately
knows which other times would really work (``windows``), whether a room
without the requested equipment would do (``room_flexible``), whether they
volunteer an alternative when asked (``reveal``) and whether they answer at
all (``responsive``). The oracle is computed with all of this known.

Policy families (proposal Section 13.1) shape the hidden profile, and each
family's stakeholders respond stochastically, so no system can succeed by
exploiting a deterministic reply rule:

* ``strict``: one narrow alternative at most, never volunteered;
* ``flexible``: any time on the days that work, and volunteers one;
* ``cost_sensitive``: only small changes (the same time of day);
* ``history_sensitive``: refuses acceptable offers more often after having
  conceded recently, independent of the negotiator's ledger.

With ``refuse_p`` an acceptable offer is refused anyway, and with
``silence_p`` a message goes unanswered; both draw from the simulator's own
seeded ``rng``. A profile without a family behaves deterministically.

The reply text is either a template (no API calls) or written by the
simulator LLM (Flash-Lite) from the scripted decision, in which case the
negotiator only sees text and must parse it (``structured=False``).
