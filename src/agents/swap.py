"""Swap requests (proposal Section 8.2, request type "swap"; handbook P-SWAP).

"Could I swap my Tuesday 10 am lecture with Dr. Rao's Thursday 2 pm one?"
names two sessions by where they are in the current timetable, so it cannot
be compiled from the message alone. After the parser recognises a swap:

1. A reader finds the two sessions in the published timetable: the
   sender's own and the colleague's. ``RuleSwapReader`` reads names, days,
   times, course titles and session kinds; ``LLMSwapReader`` shows a model
   both people's timetables. Either returns a question when the message
   fits more than one pair or none.
2. The colleague is asked for consent (P-SWAP: "with the consent of both")
   through the same inbox as negotiation messages: one option, accept or
   decline.
3. On consent each session gets a hard time pin at the other's slot for the
   weeks named (or the semester); rooms are left to the solver. The request
   then goes through the ordinary solve, negotiation and approval, so the
   swap "must not break any other regulation" is checked by CP-SAT and the
   coordinator is informed before it takes effect.

Deterministic checks the model cannot override: the sender owns the first
session, the colleague the second, and they are different people.
