"""Orchestrator: the request lifecycle (proposal Figure 2) end to end.

Received -> Classified (System One routes: fast path to the compiler, or
System Two) -> Policy checked (RAG) -> Compiled + validated -> Solved
(CP-SAT repair) -> Negotiating (resolution ladder) -> Fairness audited ->
Awaiting approval -> Published + notified.

Safe exits: Refused (no authority), Denied (policy, with citation and
alternative), Clarification requested, Escalated, Answered, Forwarded.

Safety properties enforced here, not by any model:

* nothing is published except by ``approve`` from a listed approver;
* message text never reaches a state-changing call: models return data,
  and only this code decides what happens with it;
* replies and notices are built from constraints, never from private reasons;
* requests are compiled and solved one at a time (``_solving``): each builds on the change before it,
  and the solver reads every constraint in the store, so two requests solved together would each
  carry the other's change (two absences in one week, each cancelling both teachers' classes).
