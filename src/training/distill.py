"""Multi-task training data for the local model (every agent-side LLM call).

The fine-tuned compiler only parses. This module builds data for the other
calls the deployed system makes, with the same system prompts and user
messages as at run time, so a model trained on it drops into ``--local``
unchanged:

* ``reply``: turn a stakeholder's free-text answer into one tool call
  (``ReplyParser``). Labels are free: the call (accept / counter / propose /
  clarify / reject / escalate) is chosen first and the simulator model, or a
  template, writes the text that says it. Some samples show the retry turn
  (the typed errors of a rejected call) with the corrected call as target.
* ``explain``: grounded explanations (``Explainer``, mode ``grounded``). The
  teacher (the Gemini agent model) writes claims; a sample is kept only if
  every claim cites known fact IDs and passes the claim checker, every
  option is cited and nothing private leaks.
* ``policy``: the policy agent. The teacher's verdict is kept only if it
  matches the corpus label, cites the gold rules and cites nothing it was
  not shown; the make-up obligation (which the teacher often misses) is set
  from the label.
* ``denials``: more policy examples, no API. Generated rule-breaking
  requests and their legal look-alikes (the same ones ``language.compiler``
  adds), and corpus denials shown with a misread parse (lunch moved an hour,
  a run cut to the limit, or no parse): the verdict comes from the message.
  Targets are the teacher's own answers from ``policy``, which are the same
  text for every denial of a rule. Saved as policy rows.
* ``compile``: the existing compiler data (``language.compiler``).

Conflicts come from benchmark scenarios generated with seeds 1.. (seed 0 is
the evaluation set and is never used); the last seed is the validation
split. Policy examples use the corpus train/val splits.

    uv run python -m training.distill messages --seeds 1-10       # negotiations, solver only (no API)
    uv run python -m training.distill reply                       # simulator model voices replies
    uv run python -m training.distill reply --voice template      # no API
    uv run python -m training.distill reply --voice template --kinds propose,clarify,escalate         --per-message 1 --name reply-tools                         # only the newer tools, beside reply.jsonl
    uv run python -m training.distill explain                     # teacher: agent model
    uv run python -m training.distill policy                      # teacher: agent model
    uv run python -m training.distill denials                     # more policy denials, no API
    uv run python -m training.distill check --files x/reply.jsonl # validate rows made elsewhere (same filters)
    uv run python -m training.distill export                      # data/multitask/{train,val}.jsonl

Every stage writes ``data/distill/<stage>.jsonl``; the Gemini client caches
every call, so a stage stopped by the daily quota resumes where it stopped
when run again.
