"""Keep working when the model server is not.

The parser, the policy check and the inbox's reply reader each have a model-backed version and a
rule-based stand-in (``RuleParser``, ``RulePolicyAgent``, ``RuleReplyParser``). ``ModelLink`` tracks
whether the model is reachable: it builds the client lazily (a server that is down at start-up
does not stop the app), probes it quickly before use (a dead host would otherwise hold a request
until the client's timeout), and after a failure leaves it alone for ``retry_after`` seconds.
``Fallback`` wraps one component: the model while the link is up, the stand-in otherwise, call by
call, so the app moves back to the model by itself when the server returns.
